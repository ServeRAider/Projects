## Projects


This repository consists of different Python projects I have worked on to improve my programming skills. 

Port Scanner.py: This is a program used to check what ports within a given range are open on an IP or Domain input by the user.
                 I created this tool to demonstrate my ability to create my own port scanner. Port scanners are valuable tools
                 for ensuring your network is properly protected. 

Luck Seven Game.py: This program creates a game using 2 random dice. The user enters the amount they would like to wager (1-100).
                    The final result will tell the user how many times the dice were rolled and what the maximum amount they had 
                    during the duration of the game.

CSVReaderpractice.py: This program is accompanied by 3 class files (CSVTrackByCount_Class.py, CSVTrackByDate_Class.py, CSVTrackByIP_Class.py)
                      to practice creating my own classes as well as building a GUI. I've attached a CSV file labeled CSVPortScanHistory
                      as an example to allow users to test the program. It allows the user to use a GUI to select the CSV file they would 
                      like to gather info from. It then prints out the result in 3 different formats providing more specific information
                      about the CSV file. The result of each value set is also saved to individual text files.   

*Note you may need to install the breezypythyongui package for it to work properly.*
