# Projects


#This repository consists of different Python projects I have worked on to improve my programming skills. 

#The project labeled Port Scanner.py is a program used to check what ports within a given range are open on an IP or Domain input by the user. 

#The project Luck Seven Game.py was an attempt at created a game using 2 random dice. The user enters the amount they would like to wager (1-100). The final result will 
#tell the user how many times the dice were rolled and what the maximum amount they had at one time is. 

#The project labeled CSV Reader practice.py is accompanied by 3 class files to practice creating my own classes as well a GUI. 
#I've attached a CSV file labeled CSVPortScanHistory as an example of how the program works. It allows the user to use
#a GUI to select the CSV file they would like to gather info from. Then it prints out the result in a specific format. 
#     *Note you may need to install the breezypythyongui package for it to work properly.
